# React-Flux forms app (js/non-js forms and Store)


Server + Client side rendering via ISO - DONE
Stores and actions via ALT - DONE
Make /edit use action + update store- DONE
Transient + Persistent - TODO

## MAYBE
Make ajax to /api route and update store on response..Flux - TODO
- not really needed as action can easily be sync/async

##  ISSUES:
1) without listener on parent updates to store dont cause re-render.
SO parent needs listener to store.
